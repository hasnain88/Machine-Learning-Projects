this dataset is a well-known one from the Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) problem, often used in machine learning and regression modeling.

Hereâ€™s what the columns mean:

AT (Ambient Temperature) â€“ The temperature outside in degrees Celsius.

V (Exhaust Vacuum) â€“ The vacuum (pressure) in cm Hg.

AP (Ambient Pressure) â€“ The atmospheric pressure in millibar.

RH (Relative Humidity) â€“ The relative humidity in percentage (%).

PE (Power Output / Energy Output) â€“ The net hourly electrical energy output of the plant in megawatts (MW).

Context

The dataset comes from a Combined Cycle Power Plant, where electrical power is generated using gas turbines and steam turbines.

The goal is typically to predict the plantâ€™s energy output (PE) based on the environmental conditions (AT, V, AP, RH).

Usage in Machine Learning

Itâ€™s commonly used for regression tasks.

Researchers and practitioners apply models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and Neural Networks to forecast PE.

The dataset is also widely used for teaching data science concepts such as feature relationships, correlation, and model evaluation.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: this dataset is about predicting how much power a combined cycle power plant produces given outside weather and environmental conditions.
